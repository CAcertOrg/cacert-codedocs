   CRL
      Definition from :rfc:`5280`:

        X.509 defines one method of certificate revocation.  This method
        involves each CA periodically issuing a signed data structure called
        a certificate revocation list (CRL).  A CRL is a time-stamped list
        identifying revoked certificates that is signed by a CA or CRL
        issuer and made freely available in a public repository.  Each
        revoked certificate is identified in a CRL by its certificate serial
        number.
