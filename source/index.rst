CAcert code documentation
=========================

This is a work in progress documentation of the CAcert web application source
code in the `release` branch of the :cacertgit:`cacert-devel`.

The goal is to document the existing code base to give insight into its
functionality and to support writing a specification for a potential
reimplementation.

The code repository is mirrored to the :github:`cacert-devel` to encourage
contribution. The canonical repository is the :cacertgit:`cacert-devel` though.
